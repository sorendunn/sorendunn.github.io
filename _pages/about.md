Hi, I'm Soren Dunn. I'm a Founding Engineer at Intology AI. I was previously a master's student at the *University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign*, supervised by Professor [Lingming Zhang](https://lingming.cs.illinois.edu/index.html). I received my bachelor's, triple majoring in Data Science, Statistics, and Chemistry from the *University of Chicago* in 2023.

News
=====
- *February 26th, 2025*: Agentless Lite <ins>doubles state-of-the-art</ins> on SWE-bench Multimodal from 12.19% to 25.34% for 1/4th of the cost without even requiring a runtime environment!
- *February 14th, 2025*: I released [Agentless Lite](https://github.com/sorendunn/Agentless-Lite) - a generalized, lightweight adaptation of the Agentless scaffold which is competitive with SOTA agents while only requiring sampling from a single RAG prompt.

- *September 12, 2024*: Agentess was used by OpenAI as their scaffold of choice for evalauting gpt-4o, o1-mini, and o1-preview's <ins>model autonomy</ins> as part of their preparedness framework
- *July 1st, 2024*: Released OpenAutoCoder-Agentless 1.0! Agentless currently is the <ins>best open-source approach</ins> on SWE-bench lite with 82 fixes (27.3%) and costing on average $0.34 per issue.

Education
=====
- Data Science (B.S.) with Honors, Statistics (B.A.), Chemistry (B.A.), University of Chicago October 2019 - June 2023

Experience
=====
- Intology AI, Founding Engineer, San Francisco, CA, January 2025 - Present
  - Developed experimentation, ideation, paper-writing capabilities, and user interface for Zochi, the first AI system to publish a paper in a top scientific venue (ACL 2025) with reviews placing it in the top 8.2% of all ACL submissions as well as publishing three papers in ICLR 2025 workshops
  - Configured Zochi to run on MLE-bench, reaching SOTA on a canonical subset of MLE-Bench achieving medals in 50% of Kaggle competitions it was tested on
