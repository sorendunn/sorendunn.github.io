Hi, I'm Soren Dunn. I'm currently a second-year master's student at *UIUC* supervised by [Lingming Zhang](https://lingming.cs.illinois.edu/index.html). I received my bachelor's triple majoring in Data Science, Statistics, and Chemistry from the *University of Chicago* in 2023. 

My research goal is to improve both the benchmarks we use to evaluate model **reasoning** along with the rigor of the approaches which we use to evaluate models on them in order to hone current efforts to build model systems capable of real-world problem solving.I am particularly focused on conducting reasoning evaluations for language models in the **coding domain**.
